# Understanding the context.
A condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women. Major symptoms include fatigue, cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin and unexplained weight gain. Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients.

We are required to create a model that will determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothroidism

# The analytical question
As a data scientist,build on model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism.
# Recording the experimental design.
> * Decision trees

Here,we will make use of 2 of the advanced models i.e; Random forest,Ada boosted trees and grandient boosted trees.

> * SVM 

---



In this method,we will begin with carrying out data cleaning,tune our parameters and finally apply the Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build your SVM model and then evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best.

Once we have the best kernel,we will use this kernel together with your tuned parameters and repeat the prediction but this time using additional features.We will then compare the model you've just created with the 2-features version.
